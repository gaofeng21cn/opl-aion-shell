# AionUi - Project Guide

All contributors (human and AI) must follow [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) before opening a PR. ([Chinese version](CONTRIBUTING.zh.md))

## One Person Lab App Boundary

This repository is the OPL-maintained AionUI shell implementation. It carries
the concrete renderer, process, package metadata, tests, shell release hooks, and
upstream AionUI intake work for the currently active One Person Lab App GUI.

The current App GUI route is fixed by the App repo: AionUI is the active
mainline implementation carrier, Hermes Desktop / `hermes-codex` is the only
foreground alternative, and AGUI / `agui-codex` is archived technical proof.
Do not treat AGUI as a default candidate, upstream source, validation baseline,
or polish lane unless the user explicitly requests AGUI replay.

The source of truth for what the One Person Lab App GUI should be is
`/Users/gaofeng/workspace/one-person-lab-app`. App-level GUI product decisions,
page-state expectations, model-selection policy, onboarding behavior, screenshots,
and release/user documentation belong in the App repo. Shell changes must follow
that App-owned product truth.

When upstream AionUI changes conflict with OPL App behavior, keep the upstream
intake isolated in this shell repo and preserve the App repo's GUI requirements.
Do not let upstream defaults, model lists, theme presets, or interaction patterns
silently become OPL App authority.

Treat this repository as a replaceable implementation carrier. If a future shell
candidate is introduced, it must be declared and gated from the App repo under
`shells/<candidate>`; GUI product authority, page-state expectations,
model-selection policy, onboarding policy, screenshots, and release/user docs
do not move into the shell repository.

## Code Conventions

### File & Directory Structure

- **Directory size limit**: A single directory must not exceed **10** direct children (files + subdirectories). Split by responsibility when approaching this limit.

See [docs/contributing/file-structure.md](docs/contributing/file-structure.md) for complete rules. Agents must also follow the `architecture` skill (`.claude/skills/architecture/SKILL.md`) when creating files or modules.

### Naming

- **Components**: PascalCase (`Button.tsx`, `Modal.tsx`)
- **Utilities**: camelCase (`formatDate.ts`)
- **Hooks**: camelCase with `use` prefix (`useTheme.ts`)
- **Constants files**: camelCase (`constants.ts`) — values inside use UPPER_SNAKE_CASE
- **Type files**: camelCase (`types.ts`)
- **Style files**: kebab-case or `ComponentName.module.css`
- **Unused params**: prefix with `_`

### UI Library & Icons

- **Components**: `@arco-design/web-react` — no raw interactive HTML (`<button>`, `<input>`, `<select>`, etc.)
- **Icons**: `@icon-park/react`

### CSS

- Prefer **UnoCSS utility classes**; complex styles use **CSS Modules** (`ComponentName.module.css`)
- Colors must use **semantic tokens** from `uno.config.ts` or CSS variables — no hardcoded values
- Arco theme overrides go in `packages/desktop/src/renderer/styles/arco-override.css`; component-scoped Arco overrides use CSS Module with `:global()`
- Global styles only in `packages/desktop/src/renderer/styles/`

Formatting rules (Oxfmt, Prettier-compatible):

- Single-element arrays that fit on one line → inline: `[{ id: 'a', value: 'b' }]`
- Trailing commas required in multi-line arrays/objects
- Single quotes for strings

### TypeScript

- Strict mode enabled — no `any`, no implicit returns
- Use path aliases: `@/*`, `@process/*`, `@renderer/*`
- Prefer `type` over `interface` (per Oxlint config)
- English for code comments; JSDoc for public functions

### Internationalization (i18n)

All user-facing text must use i18n keys — never hardcode strings. Languages and modules are defined in `packages/desktop/src/common/config/i18n-config.json`.

See the `i18n` skill (`.claude/skills/i18n/SKILL.md`) for complete workflow, key naming, and validation steps.

## Architecture

Two process types — never mix their APIs:

| Process  | Path                             | Restriction     |
| -------- | -------------------------------- | --------------- |
| Main     | `packages/desktop/src/process/`  | No DOM APIs     |
| Renderer | `packages/desktop/src/renderer/` | No Node.js APIs |

Cross-process communication must go through the IPC bridge (`packages/desktop/src/preload/`).
See [docs/architecture/overview.md](docs/architecture/overview.md) for details.

## Testing

**Framework**: Vitest 4 (`vitest.config.ts`). Coverage target ≥ 80%.

```bash
bun run test              # default fast Vitest lane (node unit + contract)
bun run test:dom          # jsdom component/hook tests
bun run test:integration  # integration tests
bun run test:full         # full Vitest lane (unit + DOM + integration/regression)
bun run test:coverage     # full Vitest lane with coverage report
```

See the `testing` skill (`.claude/skills/testing/SKILL.md`) for complete workflow and quality rules.

## Workflow

### During Development

Auto-fix as you edit:

```bash
bun run lint:fix       # auto-fix lint issues (oxlint)
bun run format         # auto-format all files (oxfmt)
bunx tsc --noEmit      # verify no type errors
```

If your changes touch `packages/desktop/src/renderer/`, `locales/`, or `packages/desktop/src/common/config/i18n`, also run:

```bash
bun run i18n:types
node scripts/check-i18n.js
```

### Before Pushing

Always use `just push` instead of `git push`:

```bash
just push                          # lint → format-check → typecheck → test → git push
just push -u origin feat/branch    # same checks, with extra git push args
```

Any step that fails aborts the push. Fix the issue, commit, then retry.

> **Note for AI agents**: `just push` uses `--quiet` for lint — only errors cause failure. The project has many pre-existing lint _warnings_ which do NOT indicate failure. Judge success by exit code, not by output volume.

### Before PR (optional stricter check)

`prek` replicates the **exact CI pipeline** (includes end-of-file, trailing whitespace checks on all file types):

```bash
# One-time setup
npm install -g @j178/prek

# Run
prek run --from-ref origin/main --to-ref HEAD
```

> `prek` is read-only — it reports but does not fix. If it reports issues, run the auto-fix commands above, commit, then re-run.

The `oss-pr` skill runs this automatically during PR creation.

### Commit & PR Format

Commit format: `<type>(<scope>): <subject>` in English. Types: feat, fix, refactor, chore, docs, test, style, perf.

**NEVER add AI signatures** (Co-Authored-By, Generated with, etc.).

For pull request creation, see the `oss-pr` skill (`.claude/skills/oss-pr/SKILL.md`).
